Cwd::Ext 
===============================================

These are some things that feel missing from Cwd. 

Questions like, 
   Is path a inside the filesystem hierarchy of path b?
   What is the resolved absolute path of a file, without dereferencing symlinks?

Unlike with Cwd, this module is in baby stage. So it is NOT tweaked for OS2, NT, etc etc.
This is developed under POSIX.

This module does not export by default. You must explicitely import what you want to use.
